        <p>Welcome to this website about Git. This part of the website is an over view of Git, as well as helpful links about it.</p>
        <p>Git is the most popular verion control system that also commonly websites such as github, if you interested in using Git, you can download it here at the its <a href='https://git-scm.com/downloads' target='_blank'>website</a>.</p>
        <p>Git was founded by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish-American programmer, who has also notably founded Linux. He wanted a verison-control system unlike any that existed at the time, so he coded one. Some of the aspects of Git is that it supports a non-linear development, distributed development, efficient handling of large projects, cryptographic authentication of history, and a lot more. If you're interested in more information about Git you can find it here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#History" target="_blank">more information</a> </p>

        <h1>Utilizations Page</h1>

        <p>Git is a version control system, that is used mostly by developers to keep track of changes to files of code, it is also used for coordinating work among programmers that are working on the source code, for softwear development. The goals of Git is speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Here is a list of the uses of Git system.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Version Control - Control the history of the code files, which allows for easy activation between them which improves development.</li>
            <li>Collobartion - Git and the remote versions such as GitHub make Collobartion on the same project much as easier, as each contribution to the source code from different people is quicky and easy.</li>
            <li>Git creates a standardized way of sharing code which makes things simpler and overall better.</li>
            <li>Provides a way for people to work on open source projects with ease.</li>
            <li>A way to keep track of how much work someone has done on a code</li>
        </ul>

    <div id='overviewPage'>
        <h1>Overview Page</h1>
        <p>In this overview page you can find keyterms as well some of the syntax that Git uses. It will all be from a linux console.</p>

        <p>These are the list of keyterms used when working with Git</p>

        <ul>
            <li>commit - A commit is a confirmd changes to a repository, such as by modifying files, adding, removing them, etc.</li>
            <li>remote - A remote is typically a repository located in a website that uses Git, such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, SourceForge, AWS CodeCommit, and a list of others.</li>
            <li>local - Local repository is a place inside the operating system.</li>
            <li>repository - This is a place where your files are stored and kept track of such as modifying, adding, combining, and more.</li>
            <li>pushing - This is when someone uploads their files from local to remote repository.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are a list of the commands in linux to use git</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>git init</code> - This command is typically used once at the beginning of creating a local repository.</li>
            <li><code>git clone remoteRepository</code> - This is used for getting a complete copy of the remote repository which could be located in websitse such as GitHub, etc.</li>
            <li><code>git log</code> - This shows a list of the commits that have been done.</li>
            <li><code>git push remoteName branchName</code> This command pushes the things in the local repository to the remote one.</li>
            <li><code>git add</code> - This command stages all the changes in a repository from the files.</li>
        </ul>

                <h5>What is the Git system?</h5>
                <p>Git is a distrubted version control system and a source code management.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>What is a repository in Git?</h5>
                <p>A repository cointains a directory that ends in .git, where git keeps all of the files for the repository.</p>
            </li>

                <h5>What are the advantages of using Git?</h5>
                <p>The advantages of using Git, are many such as Data redundancy and replication, Hight availablity, only one .git directory per repository, superior disk utilization and netweok performance, collaboration friendly, and almost any sort of projects can use Git.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>What is the purpose of branching in Git?</h5>
                <p>This allows to create different branches that can be jumped between, which can allow to go to different verions of the project.</p>
            </li>
